 ## Variables

 In Swift, we store data in variables and constants. Use `let` to make a `constant` and `var` to make a `variable`.
 */

let school = "Lighthouse Labs"
var students = 0
students = 7

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Try creating a variable and/or constant for your name, and age.
 What happens if you try to change the value of a constant?
 */
let name = "Yongwoo Huh"
var age = 35
age = 36

/*:
 ## Types
 
 Types are very important in Swift. When you create a variable, that variable has a *type*. This means that the variable can only hold one _type_ of data. If the variable is of _type_ `String`, that means you can't assign a number to it.
 
 - Experiment:
 Hold down the Option key and click on the variables `school` and `students` above to see a popup window with information about the variable. If we click on `school`, we can see it's a `String`. What type is `students`?
 */
// Students is of type Int
/*:
 We can change the data stored in a variable using the *assignment operator* `'='`. The new value must _always_ be the same type as the variable, you can't assign a new value with a different type.
 
 - Experiment:
  Try changing the value of `weeksCompleted` to another integer.
  What happens if you try to change the value to a `String` like "4"?
  What happens if you try to change the value to a `Double` like 4.1?
 */

var weeksCompleted = 4.5

/*:
 As you can see, you don't have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler _infer_ its type. In the example above, the compiler infers that `students` is an integer because its initial value is an integer.
 
 If the initial value doesnâ€™t provide enough information (or if there is no initial value), specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon.
 */

let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70

/*:
 Here are some basic types which you've also seen in Objective-C:

 * String - a collection of characters inside "quotation marks"
 * Bool - either true or false
 * Int - a whole number. ex) 5
 * Double - a decimal number with more precision. ex) 5.55
*/
/*:
 - Experiment:
 Create a constant with an explicit type of `Float` and a value of `4`.
 */
/*:
 - Experiment:
 What type are the variables `tipAmount`, and `isOpen`?
 */

let explicitFloat: Float = 4

var tipAmount = 6.01
// tipAmount's type is: Double


var isOpen = true
// isOpen's type is: Bool

/*:
Values are never implicitly converted to another type. If you need to convert a value to a different type, explicitly make an instance of the desired type.
*/

let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Try removing the conversion to `String` from the last line. What error do you get?
 */
// binary operator cannot be applied to two different types
